# ExodusGameRemake-Unity-2019

This is a 2-person group project that was created in Software Project class at PLNU. It is an attempt to 
re-create an old DOS video game called Exodus- Journey to the Promised Land. We created this game using Unity, 
and it mimics the first 5 levels of the original game.
